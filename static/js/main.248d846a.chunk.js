Such programmes are essential as they not only promote gender equality but also empower women to take decisions for themselves and their families. These programmes are very effective and often have a dramatic impact not only on women participating in this programme but also on adolescent children in their families and neighbourhood, as they are also encouraged to attend school regularly and decrease the dropout rate.

This scientific temper, or scientific attitude is basically characterized by the traits like a healthy scepticism, universalism, freedom from prejudice or bias, objectivity, open mindednes and humility, willingness to suspend judgment without sufficient evidence,rationality, perseverance and positive approach to failure. Normally, a person having scientific attitude uses the method of science in his/her daily life decision making process. Our first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru was very fond of using the term Scientific Temper and was keen that we should not learn sciences superficially\u2019 i.e. just the facts of biology or chemistry and physics.

Cancer can be categorized as a group of diseases which is caused by the abnormal growth of cells. This abnormal growth of cells leads to the formation of lumps or masses of tissues called tumor (except in cases like leukaemia where cancer prohibits normal function by abnormal cell division in the blood stream and also leucoedema where blisters filled with whitish-grey mucous are formed on the skin). The primary goal of World Cancer Day is to significantly reduce the illness and the deaths caused by cancer. Many a times due to lack of knowledge people tend to ignore the symptoms which may later turn out to be extremely fatal. Cancer if diagnosed at an early stage can be quite helpful as the treatment can be started off right away. Today the number of people suffering from cancer has exponentially increased due to various reasons such as global warming, mutations, and sometimes even unhealthy dietary habits. It\u2019s important for people to know about these things so that they can avoid uneventful health disasters. Cervical cancer and ovarian cancer are the two most widely suffered cancers among Indian women. Educating them about menstrual hygiene will serve a great deal in preventing them from suffering in the future. Hamraah Foundation celebrates World Cancer Day to impart knowledge about cancer, its types, symptoms, diagnosis and also its treatment. Beneficiaries Participating in this event are educated about how they can prevent cancer by following a healthy diet and by cultivating healthy habits.

Hamraah Foundation launched the project among marginalised women Self Help Groups for sustainable livelihood with the partner GlobalHunt Foundation to further the menstrual hygiene agenda among the underprivileged women of the society. Sofy Sahyogi Project is the community led project designed by the Unicharm India Pvt Ltd and GlobalHunt Foundation to sensitize the women community on the issue of menstruation. Women over the years have developed negligence over menstrual hygiene and sanitation. This coupled with lack of basic water and sanitation amenities both at the individual and at the community level, non-availability of the sanitary products, dependency on male counterparts for the purchase of products (especially in semi-urban and rural geographies due to restricted mobility) and hesitation towards discussing menstruation in public domain have resulted towards a lack of formulation of objective regulatory policies and practices at social level. Also, among families, distribution of income on the purchase of sanitary products especially for women is seen as a special benefit than as a special need. Therefore, women developed their own practices in respect of usage and disposal which poses threats to their own health. To address the serious issue of menstrual hygiene Unicharm India CSR initiated a first-of-its-kind \u201cSahyogi\u201d project in Jahangirpuri slums, New Delhi. Hamraah Foundations partnered with the GlobalHunt foundation and launched the project among ten marginalised women Self Help Groups, comprising of 100 women for the awareness, accessibility and availability of the sanitary napkins at the same time addressing the issue of livelihood of these destitute women. The prime purpose of the project was to penetrate in those sectors of communities where menstruation and issues related to its hygiene remain unaddressed. To address the issue, the project team identified Sahyogis from the community who acted as change agents for the community. Through Sofy Sahyogi the community gained accessibility to sanitary pads at reasonable price whenever required and with time, ceased their dependency on the male members. Also, from time to time Sofy Sahyogi sensitized women about the issue and provided knowledge on the menstrual hygiene management. The Sahyogi project has been able to break the gap of community interaction and has created two way communications between Unicharm India and local community.
